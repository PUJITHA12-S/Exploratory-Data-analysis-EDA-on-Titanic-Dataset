# Exploratory-Data-analysis-EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset


# Introduction

The Titanic dataset is popular for data analysis. It contains information about the passengers
 onboard the Titanic, including features like age, gender, fare, cabin, and survival status. We
 will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python in this
 project.

 # Dataset

 The Titanic dataset is available in Seaborn as the ‘titanic’ dataset. It consists of the following
 columns:
 Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
 Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)
 Sex: Passenger’s gender
 Age: Passenger’s age
 SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
 Parch:Number of parents/children aboard
 Fare: Fare paid for the ticket
 Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
 Class: Equivalent to Pclass (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)
 Who: Passenger’s category (man, woman, child)
