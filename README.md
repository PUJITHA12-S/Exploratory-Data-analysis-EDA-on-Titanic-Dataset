# Introduction

The Titanic dataset is popular for data analysis. It contains information about the passengers
 onboard the Titanic, including features like age, gender, fare, cabin, and survival status. We
 will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python in this
 project.

 # Dataset

 The Titanic dataset is available in Seaborn as the â€˜titanicâ€™ dataset. It consists of the following
 columns:
 * Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
 * Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)
 * Sex: Passengerâ€™s gender
 * Age: Passengerâ€™s age
 * SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
 * Parch:Number of parents/children aboard
 * Fare: Fare paid for the ticket
 * Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
 * Class: Equivalent to Pclass (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)
 * Who: Passengerâ€™s category (man, woman, child)

# Tools 

  Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Google Colab
ðŸ’¡ This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Data cleaning and preprocessing
  * Data visualization and storytelling with insights

# Analysis Questions:

1. How many passengers were on board the Titanic in this dataset?
2. What is the overall surival rate of passengers?
3. what is distribution of passengers across different classes(Pclass)?
4. How many male, female Passengers were there?
5. what is average age of passengers
6. what is survival rate for each clas(Pclass)
7. did woman have a highest survival rate than men?
8. what was the average fare paid by passenger in each class?
9. what is correlation between sibsp and survival?

#  Conclusion:

# Insight & Recommendations:

In this Titanic data analysis project, we conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python. The dataset contained information on 891 passengers, including demographic and travel-related details. Through the analysis, we derived the following key insights:

* Survival Rate: Only 38.38% of passengers survived the disaster, while 61.62% did not survive.
* Passenger Class Impact: Most passengers (55%) were in 3rd class. However, survival rates were highest in 1st class (15.26%) and lowest in 2nd class (9.76%), highlighting that passenger class significantly influenced chances of survival.
* Gender Distribution & Survival: 64.76% of the passengers were male, and 35.24% were female. Females had a higher survival rate than males, suggesting gender played a key role during evacuation and rescue.
* Average_Age Factor: The average age of passengers was approximately 29 years, indicating most travelers were young adults. There was no strong correlation between age and survival based on this data alone.
* Embarkation & Deck: Majority of passengers embarked from Southampton, and the most common deck recorded was 'C'. Missing values were appropriately handled to ensure data integrity.
* This analysis highlights the influence of socio-economic status, gender, and class on survival during the Titanic tragedy. Such insights not only help understand historical events but also demonstrate the value 
  of data analysis in uncovering patterns and informing future safety measures.
